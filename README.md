# Soapy SDR plugin for AirspyHF+

## This branch (v2)

**This branch is work in progress**.

The code is significantly simpler than the previous version and most
likely it has better performance. Quite a few bugs have been fixed,
and some new ones have probably been introduced. Please help me find
them! :-)

I have tested this with GQRX and OpenWebRX with good results.
